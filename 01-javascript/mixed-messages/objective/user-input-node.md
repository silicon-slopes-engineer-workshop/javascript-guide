# Getting User Input in Node.js
> Learn how to handle user input synchronously in Node.js.


## Synchronous Input

`Node.js` allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser window, offering powerful tools to interact with a computer filesystem, run web servers, and create terminal applications. Node handles these tasks by running asynchronously, which means that reading user input from a terminal isn’t as simple as calling a `getInput()` function. In this article, we’ll show you an easy way around that (and some tips and tricks for handling user input) by using a helpful Node module.


## Working with Input

`Node.js` provides a few ways to handle interactions, including the built-in process object and readline module. While these are powerful tools, they rely on callback functions and can be confusing to work with at first.

```js
const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});
 
readline.question('Who are you?', name => {
  console.log(`Hey there ${name}!`);
  readline.close();
});
```

Running this code in Node, you’d see:

```bash
$ node read.js
Who are you?
> 
```

Then you could enter your input based on the prompt and see the response:

```bash
$ node read.js
Who are you?
> Codecademy
Hey there Codecademy!
$
```

This works as intended, but it’s a lot of **boilerplate**, and you need to call `readline.question()` and create a **callback function** every time you want to use it for input. There’s a simpler way, whether you’re just getting started out with JavaScript development or just want to get an interactive script running as quickly as possible.

## Using `prompt-sync`

The `prompt-sync` [Node module](https://github.com/heapwolf/prompt-sync) provides an easy-to-use alternative to this callback-based syntax.

1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed

2. Run `npm install prompt-sync` in the terminal

```js
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
```

Notice the extra `()` after `require()`. The `prompt-sync` module is a function that creates prompting functions, so you need to call `prompt-sync` in order to get your actual prompting function.

Once you’ve loaded the `prompt-sync` module and called it, using it to retrieve user input is relatively straightforward:

```js
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
 
const name = prompt('What is your name?');
console.log(`Hey there ${name}`);
```

The `prompt()` function returns the user feedback, so simply store that return value to a variable to use it later. In the example above, the `name` variable stores the value, and it is then repeated to the user on the next line.


## Letting Users Exit

By default, most terminal programs will exit with `Ctrl + C` (This sends a `SIGINT`, or **“signal interrupt”** message indicating that a user wants to exit a program). With prompt-sync, in order to make sure that your users can exit at will, add a configuration object with `sigint: true` when invoking the prompt-sync function:

```js
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')({sigint: true});
```


## Working with Numbers

All user input will be read as a String, so in order to treat user input as numbers, you’ll need to convert the input:

```js
const num = prompt('Enter a number: ');
console.log('Your number + 4 =');
console.log(Number(num) + 4);
```


## Making a basic app

The code below creates a small number guessing application.

```js
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')({sigint: true});
 
// Random number from 1 - 10
const numberToGuess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
// This variable is used to determine if the app should continue prompting the user for input
let foundCorrectNumber = false;
 
while (!foundCorrectNumber) {
  // Get user input
  let guess = prompt('Guess a number from 1 to 10: ');
  // Convert the string input to a number
  guess = Number(guess);
 
  // Compare the guess to the secret answer and let the user know.
  if (guess === numberToGuess) {
    console.log('Congrats, you got it!');
    foundCorrectNumber = true;
  } else {
    console.log('Sorry, guess again!');
  }
}
```
