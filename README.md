# JavaScript Guide

> **Status**: Still in processing of building the page

This is the Static webpage that you can clone to run on your local machine.

It will look nicer on the local machine instead of running through the github link. However, the docs will be read in markdown files that have been converted to HTML.

Please note that if you don't clone this repo, it will look very bland, but that is ok! When you click on the link to the documents, they will all be static but readable especially the codes!

## About

This is the page that I use mostly to write down my notes. I usually take notes within the Wiki page of this repo, however, the wiki pages ran out of space to keep all my note. Therefore, I upgrade this study guide pages into a full static page with links to the converted markdown file.

There are also projects located within for my future references, in case I need to look back and see what I did to the code. The static site will also send me to those project when I click on the link.

**Notice** that this projects link navigation has not been implemented in the code yet!
